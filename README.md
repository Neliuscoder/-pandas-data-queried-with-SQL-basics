# -pandas-data-queried-with-SQL-basics
SQL commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

I started by loading a sample dataset into a pandas dataframe and then querying it using SQL commands using the pandasql package. I selected specific columns from a table, filter rows based on a certain condition using the WHERE clause, sort results using ORDER BY, group data using GROUP BY, and join two tables together using different types of joins.
